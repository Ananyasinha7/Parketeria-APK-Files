# Unique Selling Points
1. Real Time Monitoring System: By using CV with the CCTV systems, we can monitor the slots' availability in real time as well as match whether the license plate number of vehicle parked is the same as booked on the app by someone for authenticity.
2. Dynamic Pricing: Using ML model, based on past records the app we will set the prices i.e on high demand days for that area, the prices for the slots will increase, and vice versa.
3. EV vehicles: Our app offers EV users to locate their charging ports on the navigation system which also helps to locate the parking slots. As companies like Ola electric and uber are also trying to find places to install their EV charging ports, in future we can collab with them and have the charging points installed in parking areas acquired by us.
4. Customizability: The parking area owners can input the details like number of parking floors and slots and if the area charges parking fees or not and many more.
5. Navigation assistance: It works like google maps and helps the user in locating their booked slot.
6. Vacant Slot Finder: Helps user in searching the availability of parking slot in mentioned parking area(if red the parking slot is already booked and if green you can proceed with the booking of the parking).
7. Time exceedance reminder: Once the time limit exceeds, notifications are sent to the user as well as charges start adding up with passage of time.
